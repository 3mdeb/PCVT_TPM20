GetAndVerifyEK2

1. Overview

This tool is designed to be used by a customer after a platform's delivery, to verify the signature of the Endorsement Key (EK) Certificate and that it matches the EK in the TPM. It performs the following steps.

o	Fetch EK Cert from TPM NV â€“ find the correct certificate based Template 
o	Verify the EK Cert against the input EK CA Public Key Chain 
o	Compare the EK in the Cert with the EK in the TPM 


2. Dependencies

5. Usage

    getAndVerifyEK2  -ekcacert <filename> [-ekc <filename>] [-ekout <filename>] [-ekindex <1 | 2>] [-endorsementpw <password>] [-v]

    -ekcacert <filename>  where the file contains a list of filenames of CA certificates
                          (including the root and intermeidate ones) for the EK certificate
    -ekc <filename>       where the file contains the EK certificate
    -ekout <filename>     where filename is the name of the output EK Cert PEM file
    -ekindex <1 | 2>      The built-in EK certificate "index" indicating which EK certificate
                          in the NV to use, RSA, or ECC. 1 for RSA and 2 for ECC.
                          This is not a required option. If not included on the command line,
                          the code will attempt to use RSA and if not found will use ECC.
    -endorsementpw        password for endorsement auth
    -v                    verbose mode
